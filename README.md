### Types of Tests

- Unit Tests - These are the lowest level tests that validate that at a base level, a function can take in an input and produce the correct output.
- Integration Tests - These are slightly more involved tests that cover a wider aspect of your code. They cover a particular use-case within your system, but they donâ€™t talk to upstream or downstream systems. These dependencies are often mocked to simulate how our system would react given mocked responses from other systems.
- End-2-End Tests - These are the most involved tests that require the most effort to setup and tear down.

### Running Tests in Go
```bash
$ go test ./...
```

### Calculating Code Coverage in Go
```bash
$ go test ./... --cover

$ go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Benchmarking go code
```bash
$ go test ./... -run=Benchmark -bench=.
```

### Linting and Formatting go code
```bash
$ golangci-lint run
```

### Generating Mocks with Mockery
```bash
$ mockery --name=MessageService
```
